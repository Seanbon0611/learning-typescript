This a a repo containing some of my notes while learning Typescript

If you want to play around with Typescript as well,

1. Install TypeScript globally to your machine
   through 'npm install -g typescript' or 'brew install typescript'

2. To complile your TypeScript code run:
   'tsc (your-filename-goes-here).ts'

This code was a follow-along from Academind's TypeScript tutorial(https://youtu.be/BwuLxPH8IDs) along with some of my code I play around with to get a better understanding.
